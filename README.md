# Weather-App

This weather app displays weather data for a large amount of cities across the world. 

All data is recieved from https://openweathermap.org/api.

Two websites are used, one for the rest API and the other is used for city selection and tide times (UK Only).
Either website can be locally hosted or hosted with a third party. (Program currently set up for local host)
Both websites need to be used for the weather app to properly work.
